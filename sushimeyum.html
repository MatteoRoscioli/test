    <h5> Sushi originated in the mountainous regions of southeast Asia over 2,000 years ago. It was originally a method used to preserve fish. It is said that sushi first originated in Japan with the introduction of wet rice culture. This original 
      sushi was called narezushi and was made by packing salted fish in cooked rice, which was then left to ferment for about a year. The fermented rice became sour and this was what helped to preserve the fish. In this method the rice is discarded and only the pickled fish is eaten. In Shiga Prefecture they still make a variant of this sushi called funazushi. Some people thought it was wasteful to throw away this rice, so they made a variation of this process by shortening the waiting time to 7 days and eating both the fish and the rice. This type of sushi is called namanare. The waiting time was further shortened to 3 days, then one day, then one night. Finally, the pickling process was dropped altogether and instead the method of serving raw fish on vinegared rice was introduced. This sushi can be eaten right away and is called nigirizushi.</h5>
    
    <h5>About 350 years ago, namanare sushi and nigirizushi were sold by peddlers called sushuri. Sushi peddlers packed sushi in tubs which they carried on their shoulders or held in their hands. They went from door to door to sell their sushi. They used such fish as carp, mackerel, gizzard shad, salmon, yellowtail, trout, sea bream and shrimp. About 200 years ago inarizushi stalls first appeared. Inarizushi consists of a pocket of deep-fried bean curd filled with vinegared rice. For busy people living in towns, sushi was a simple and fast meal. For this reason its popularity grew. Sushi was first sold by peddlers and at sushi stalls, but fancy sushi shops soon appeared which offered their cuisine at very high prices. Then about 150 years ago the Shogunate Government of Edo handed down an official notice stating that all extravagant styles of living were to be banned. It is said that at this time over 200 fancy sushi shop owners ignored this notice and were punished.</h5>
    
    <h5>Today sushi is loved the world over, not only for its excellent taste but also because it is very healthy. Remember that it first came about long ago as a way of preserving a precious food source. So let's be thankful and savor each bite of sushi!</h5>
